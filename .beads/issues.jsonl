{"id":"incepto-house-vkg","title":"Review section reorganization: items moved out of Built by Inceptans","description":"The original bento.me data had OpenAI, Outliers Fund, Agora Discord, and Quartz all under Built by Inceptans. The current site moved them to a separate Resources \u0026 Community section. Consider whether these should be moved back to match the original, or if the reorganization makes sense (since these aren't literally companies built by Inceptans). Similarly, NVC Translator was moved from Cool Projects to Built by Inceptans, and Qigong Guide was moved from Cool Projects to Useful Links. Review each placement decision and decide what's most accurate.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-12T00:08:07.615382-08:00","updated_at":"2026-02-12T00:08:13.957417-08:00"}
